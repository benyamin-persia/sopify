I‚Äôm a DD, and even in my least padded and most constricting bra, I still get the ‚Äúgap‚Äù when buttoning up, since it can‚Äôt stretch over my chest. It‚Äôs not so tight that the shirt will rip off if I flex, but it‚Äôs noticeable and will have to be pinned to be wearable.

I‚Äôm a DD, and even in my least padded and most constricting bra, I still get the ‚Äúgap‚Äù when buttoning up, since it can‚Äôt stretch over my chest. It‚Äôs not so tight that the shirt will rip off if I flex, but it‚Äôs noticeable and will have to be pinned to be wearable.

The cut of it is very feminine and flattering. Despite what I‚Äôm about to say, I‚Äôm going to keep it since I love it so much and want to make it work.

I wear a 16/18 in most clothes, so I got a XXL to be safe (I also looked at the size chart). Unfortunately, this top has the problem most women‚Äôs button ups do: the bust!

I‚Äôm a DD, and even in my least padded and most constricting bra, I still get the ‚Äúgap‚Äù when buttoning up, since it can‚Äôt stretch over my chest. It‚Äôs not so tight that the shirt will rip off if I flex, but it‚Äôs noticeable and will have to be pinned to be wearable.

If you‚Äôve got a big chest, be careful. I hope women‚Äôs button ups start adding more buttons over the chest :(Read more",""

I wear a 16/18 in most clothes, so I got a XXL to be safe (I also looked at the size chart). Unfortunately, this top has the problem most women‚Äôs button ups do: the bust!

I‚Äôm a DD, and even in my least padded and most constricting bra, I still get the ‚Äúgap‚Äù when buttoning up, since it can‚Äôt stretch over my chest. It‚Äôs not so tight that the shirt will rip off if I flex, but it‚Äôs noticeable and will have to be pinned to be wearable.

I wear a 16/18 in most clothes, so I got a XXL to be safe (I also looked at the size chart). Unfortunately, this top has the problem most women‚Äôs button ups do: the bust!

I‚Äôm a DD, and even in my least padded and most constricting bra, I still get the ‚Äúgap‚Äù when buttoning up, since it can‚Äôt stretch over my chest. It‚Äôs not so tight that the shirt will rip off if I flex, but it‚Äôs noticeable and will have to be pinned to be wearable.

I wear a 16/18 in most clothes, so I got a XXL to be safe (I also looked at the size chart). Unfortunately, this top has the problem most women‚Äôs button ups do: the bust!

I‚Äôm a DD, and even in my least padded and most constricting bra, I still get the ‚Äúgap‚Äù when buttoning up, since it can‚Äôt stretch over my chest. It‚Äôs not so tight that the shirt will rip off if I flex, but it‚Äôs noticeable and will have to be pinned to be wearable.

I wear a 16/18 in most clothes, so I got a XXL to be safe (I also looked at the size chart). Unfortunately, this top has the problem most women‚Äôs button ups do: the bust!

I‚Äôm a DD, and even in my least padded and most constricting bra, I still get the ‚Äúgap‚Äù when buttoning up, since it can‚Äôt stretch over my chest. It‚Äôs not so tight that the shirt will rip off if I flex, but it‚Äôs noticeable and will have to be pinned to be wearable.

I wear a 16/18 in most clothes, so I got a XXL to be safe (I also looked at the size chart). Unfortunately, this top has the problem most women‚Äôs button ups do: the bust!

I‚Äôm a DD, and even in my least padded and most constricting bra, I still get the ‚Äúgap‚Äù when buttoning up, since it can‚Äôt stretch over my chest. It‚Äôs not so tight that the shirt will rip off if I flex, but it‚Äôs noticeable and will have to be pinned to be wearable.

If you‚Äôve got a big chest, be careful. I hope women‚Äôs button ups start adding more buttons over the chest :(Read more",""

I wear a 16/18 in most clothes, so I got a XXL to be safe (I also looked at the size chart). Unfortunately, this top has the problem most women‚Äôs button ups do: the bust!

I‚Äôm a DD, and even in my least padded and most constricting bra, I still get the ‚Äúgap‚Äù when buttoning up, since it can‚Äôt stretch over my chest. It‚Äôs not so tight that the shirt will rip off if I flex, but it‚Äôs noticeable and will have to be pinned to be wearable.

I had my eye on a few designs that would make great gifts for my mom, but I had to vet the company and quality before buying more. Shipping did take a bit, but the FAQ makes that very clear so I wasn't surprised. When my package was lost by the carrier (it happens to everyone), the support I received from the seller was phenomenal. I now have my two shirts, and I am over the moon! They're silky soft, and extremely flattering. Trust the sizing chart for chest measurement - I'm normally a large in women's tops, and the sizing chart said I was an XL. I ordered another size up (2XL) because I was afraid of not being able to wear my gorgeous shirts if they were too tight, and do wish I had gone withthe sizing chart recommendation. That said, even though I ordered a size larger than I was supposed to, the fit is still incredible. Nothing is hugging me tightly, but nothing is so boxy that it's unflattering, just oversized. Based on the feel of the fabric, I'm going to guess these need delicate care, but I know it'll be worth it. My husband pointed it out as soon as I opened my order up and said he loved it - he doesn't weigh in on my buys a lot! 10,000/10 I love this shop and love these designs!Read more",""

I immediately ordered this and the Arcadia Button Up. I had my eye on a few designs that would make great gifts for my mom, but I had to vet the company and quality before buying more. Shipping did take a bit, but the FAQ makes that very clear so I wasn't surprised. When my package was lost by the carrier (it happens to everyone), the support I received from the seller was phenomenal. I now have my two shirts, and I am over the moon! They're silky soft, and extremely flattering. Trust the sizing chart for chest measurement - I'm normally a large in women's tops, and the sizing chart said I was an XL. I ordered another size up (2XL) because I was afraid of not being able to wear my gorgeous shirts if they were too tight, and do wish I had gone withthe sizing chart recommendation. That said, even though I ordered a size larger than I was supposed to, the fit is still incredible. Nothing is hugging me tightly, but nothing is so boxy that it's unflattering, just oversized. Based on the feel of the fabric, I'm going to guess these need delicate care, but I know it'll be worth it.

So, this bug print, right?! I wore this shirt the day I got it, and the first person I saw complimented the shirt immediately. The art is gorgeous, and a high quality with tons of details that really shine on the fabric and with the exciting colors. Because of the range of colors, I can match this with a lot. While I don't frequently need to dress professionally, unless in a staunch environment, I would feel comfortable wearing this with a suit to meet clients. That said, I usually wear it tucked into a pair of jeans! It looks great either way.Read more",""

I wear a 16/18 in most clothes, so I got a XXL to be safe (I also looked at the size chart). Unfortunately, this top has the problem most women‚Äôs button ups do: the bust!

I‚Äôm a DD, and even in my least padded and most constricting bra, I still get the ‚Äúgap‚Äù when buttoning up, since it can‚Äôt stretch over my chest. It‚Äôs not so tight that the shirt will rip off if I flex, but it‚Äôs noticeable and will have to be pinned to be wearable.

I had my eye on a few designs that would make great gifts for my mom, but I had to vet the company and quality before buying more. Shipping did take a bit, but the FAQ makes that very clear so I wasn't surprised. When my package was lost by the carrier (it happens to everyone), the support I received from the seller was phenomenal. I now have my two shirts, and I am over the moon! They're silky soft, and extremely flattering. Trust the sizing chart for chest measurement - I'm normally a large in women's tops, and the sizing chart said I was an XL. I ordered another size up (2XL) because I was afraid of not being able to wear my gorgeous shirts if they were too tight, and do wish I had gone withthe sizing chart recommendation. That said, even though I ordered a size larger than I was supposed to, the fit is still incredible. Nothing is hugging me tightly, but nothing is so boxy that it's unflattering, just oversized. Based on the feel of the fabric, I'm going to guess these need delicate care, but I know it'll be worth it. My husband pointed it out as soon as I opened my order up and said he loved it - he doesn't weigh in on my buys a lot! 10,000/10 I love this shop and love these designs!Read more",""

So, this bug print, right?! I wore this shirt the day I got it, and the first person I saw complimented the shirt immediately. The art is gorgeous, and a high quality with tons of details that really shine on the fabric and with the exciting colors. Because of the range of colors, I can match this with a lot. While I don't frequently need to dress professionally, unless in a staunch environment, I would feel comfortable wearing this with a suit to meet clients. That said, I usually wear it tucked into a pair of jeans! It looks great either way.Read more",""
